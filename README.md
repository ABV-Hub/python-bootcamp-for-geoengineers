**Python Bootcamp for Geoengineers** was created in June 2020, seeing lots of geoengineers and geoscientists are interested to start programming in Python. This Bootcamp is structured into **4 Courses** and **1 Demo Room** (so far), each of the courses contains several modules that can be accessed using **Google Colab**, a web-cloud Python IDE. 

It is always recommended to start with the first 2 courses (**Intro to Python I and II**). Then, you could choose either to take the **Python Course for Oil and Gas** (ideal for geoengineers, such as petroleum engineers or reservoir engineers) or to take the **Python Course for Geoscience** (ideal for geoscientists, such as geologists or geophysicists). 

At the end of each course, there is a dummy **Exam** to test how far you already master each course!

Enjoy!
