Python Bootcamp for Geoengineers is a GitHub repository that stores all of available materials to start learning and working with Python for needs in oil and gas exploration and production, energy sector, and geoscience. This repo also stores all Jupyter notebooks that I give training to several SPEs student and professional sections. Some materials also linked to other repos and packages that I created (e.g. *PyReservoir* and *PyReSim*) where they're used. 

## Introduction to Python for Exploration and Production Course

This is a 1-day (3-hour) workshop I gave with SPE Trisakti Student Chapter, Indonesia, in September 13rd, 2020. Around 450 participants registered for this training session.

**yohanesnuwara/yohanesnuwara** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

**Python Bootcamp for Geoengineers** was created in June 2020, seeing lots of geoengineers and geoscientists are interested to start programming in Python. This Bootcamp is structured into **4 Courses** and **1 Demo Room** (so far), each of the courses contains several modules that can be accessed using **Google Colab**, a web-cloud Python IDE. 

It is always recommended to start with the first 2 courses (**Intro to Python I and II**). Then, you could choose either to take the **Python Course for Oil and Gas** (ideal for geoengineers, such as petroleum engineers or reservoir engineers) or to take the **Python Course for Geoscience** (ideal for geoscientists, such as geologists or geophysicists). 

At the end of each course, there is a dummy **Exam** to test how far you already master each course!

Enjoy!
